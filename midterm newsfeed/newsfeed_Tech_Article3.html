                    An FE version is priced at P44,995, which features a previous generation flagship chipset, 
                        the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    ASUS launched their eighth generation gaming smartphone, the ROG Phone 9, in March, featuring its expected combo of top-of-the-line specs and extra gaming-centric features such as a mini-LED panel on the back. .
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The ROG Phone 9 will come in 3 variants: Two Pro models (one is called “Pro” and the other is a 
                    “Pro Edition” and a more affordable FE version. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The most expensive Pro variant, the Pro Edition, comes in at P76,995 featuring a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and a massive amount of RAM at 24GB, and 1TB of storage. It also comes with a cooling accessory called the AeroActive Cooler X Pro. .
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The other Pro variant is priced at P62,995, and comes with less RAM at 16GB and 512GB of storage. It will also not be packaged with the Cooler X pro. It comes with the same 8 Elite chipset. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The cheapest variant is the FE, priced at P44,995, which comes with a previous generation flagship chipset (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3), 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The phone will be available at an early bird rate of P39,995 before it switches to its regular price. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Unique to ROG Phones are a miniLED panel at the back, which can be programmed to display various animations that “react to phone interactions.” The Pro models have 648 programmable LEDs while the FE version has 341. A trademark of the phone line is the AirTrigger touch system that allows for buttons on the sides of the phone for various game applications. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Other gaming-centric features include settings for auto-collecting items in games, programming skills upgrades, AI-enabled automatic recording of key in-game moments, and in-game translation of text. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The phones also boast a display (6.78 inches AMOLED) that has a 185Hz refresh rate — a number that you don’t usually see even on flagship phones. A smooth display is something that gamers appreciate so ASUS certainly bumped up that spec here. The company also touts its cooling technology, and its attachable AeroActive Cooler X Pro accessory, letting the phone stay cooler in the hand for longer gaming sessions, and to maintain stable performance. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The Cooler X Pro has the added benefits of a subwoofer to add to the audio experience, and two extra buttons for added control options. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    All the phones are IP68 dust and waterproof. The two Pro models have a 5,800 battery, while the FE has a 5,500 mAh one — all have 65-watt fast-charging. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    A key difference between the Pro models and the FE is the camera setup. The latter has 50MP main, 13MP ultrawide, and 5MP macro, while the Pro versions have the same main and ultrawide but come with a 32MP telephoto instead of a 5MP macro. 
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The gaming-centric, flagship tier phones are now available at ROG concept stores.
