                    I reckon a Community Notes model for social media platforms doesn't quite do the 
                    job of addressing falsehoods and providing context to misleading statements well enough
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    As some of you may already know, Meta’s social media platforms — 
                    Facebook, Instagram, and Threads — are following the tack of X, 
                    formerly Twitter, in adopting a Community Notes model for itself when it comes 
                    to people making statements on the internet.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Meta itself started testing the Community Notes model for its services on Tuesday, 
                    March 18, with around 200,000 potential contributors in the US signing up for the system. 
                    This came after it ended its fact-checking program in the United States.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Now, that’s all well and good, but does the Community Notes model actually 
                    help as much when compared to a dedicated fact-checking initiative? 
                    I would reckon it doesn’t quite do the job of addressing falsehoods and 
                    providing context to misleading statements well enough.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Let’s dive in.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subheader-tf">
                    How does the Community Notes model work?
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The Community Notes model has users of a given service providing context to 
                    contentious posts needing clarifications. X and Meta both note that the community’s 
                    notes aren’t decided on by the companies themselves but by a consensus of people from 
                    across the political spectrum.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    As Meta says in its post for its testing phase, “No matter how many contributors agree on a note, 
                    it won’t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context.”
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    This is well-meaning, but context is quite difficult to assign on X or 
                    Meta’s services if there’s a character limit to your explanations. Meta’s Community Notes model, 
                    for example, has a 500-character limit and requires a link to data or information supporting the 
                    contextualization of a post so it can be put up for consideration and used.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Further, in the Community Notes model, the reach of a given post is not affected even if 
                    there’s a contextual note appended to it. As Meta explained in its FAQ on its testing phase, 
                    “Notes will provide extra context, but they won’t impact who can see the content or how widely 
                    it can be shared.”
                </p>
                <p class="section-subheader-tf">
                    What’s so bad about having community notes?
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    So, as you might have inferred, X and Meta are passing the buck of policing social media 
                    for falsehoods onto its user base, requiring them to be succinct, and for a note to be 
                    accepted by the spectrum of political thought before it can be appended to a post.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    While there’s technically nothing wrong about setting up a Community Notes model for your platform, 
                    it also doesn’t address the deficiencies of a world inundated with bullshit and competing ideologies.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Poynter Institute’s MediaWise Director Alex Mahadevan, in a 2023 discussion with fact-checkers, 
                    pointed out one shortcoming of the model, in that Community Notes can be gamed or brigaded against 
                    having a note put on something if there’s no “ideological consensus” towards what is true.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    At that time, X users had written some 122,000 notes over the course of the program, 
                    but the average X user could only see around 10,400, or about 8.5% of them.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Worse still, a community note of 500 characters lends itself to a somewhat limited tackling 
                    of a contentious post. At best, it can add nuance, but you can expect most accepted community 
                    notes to just be more or less binary.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    \A note comprising “This is true!” or “This is false!” or “This is made with AI” statements 
                    and an appended link also do little to dissuade someone from sharing something that feels 
                    right to them.
                </p>
                <p class="section-subheader-tf">
                    Fact-checkers just do it better!
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    I personally scoff at the idea of X and Meta saying Community Notes would be “less biased 
                    than the third-party fact checking program it replaces, and to operate at a greater scale 
                    when it is fully up and running.”
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    People who fact-check for a living, and who do it professionally with a code of ethics 
                    pointed towards the truth and not ideological equilibrium will also happen to do the job of 
                    policing falsehoods better.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    True enough, Maldita.es, in an analysis of the impact of X’s community notes, 
                    made it clear that fact-checking organizations are a commonly used reference for 
                    community notes made around the world on X.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    According to their analysis of the the 1,175,837 community notes proposed by X users worldwide 
                    in 2024, fact-checking organizations are the third-most used reference behind other X posts 
                    and Wikipedia, with links to fact-checkers making up 1 in every 27 notes proposed. 
                    Community notes that link to fact-checked information are also more trusted by X users and 
                    thus more likely to become visible alongside tweets with disinformation.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Contrary to what X and Meta would have you believe, a fact-checked citation is is 
                    also generally faster to be adopted as part of a community note than just your standard 
                    non-fact-checked citation. Said Maldita.es, “They become visible 90 minutes earlier than 
                    general notes.”

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    For lies to stop spreading, they must be called out for what they are, nipped at the bud, 
                    and reduced in or removed from circulation so as to not let it grow into something worse.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    The Community Notes model fails to kill off lies for a false sense of ideological 
                    equilibrium and will allow them to spread regardless.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    If Meta and X were truly concerned with anything other than getting engagement bucks, 
                    it would be biased towards nothing less than the truth, even if the truth is scary, 
                    or off-putting, or painful to accept.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Instead, social media platforms with Community Notes models will let a lie remain on the internet 
                    like a puddle of ever-growing quicksand, with a note attached to a pole saying, “You may not what 
                    to step on that puddle,” waiting for people to drown in the muck.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Meta and X should hire fact-checkers to do the job of fighting off falsehoods and then these 
                    platforms should focus on deplatforming liars, even if their CEOs themselves are caught being 
                    bullshit artists.
