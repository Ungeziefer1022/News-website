                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Many young audiences reach out to her during her live sessions, often asking for advice on love and relationships.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    “I get a lot of questions from young audiences about romance, heartbreak and navigating relationships. It’s amusing because I never expected to be a love guru, but I do my best to share my thoughts. It makes me feel good because I’m able to connect with them, and in a way, it reminds me of how my own journey in love and life has unfolded,” she shared.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    “Of course, I also hear from older fans who still remember me as Doña Buding from my ‘Penthouse Live’ days! It’s such a thrill to know they still recall that after all these years — it was six years of weekly shows that rated really well,” she added.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Her ability to remain relevant in different eras is a testament to her adaptability. Over the last decade, Nanette has successfully transitioned to digital platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, creating short, satirical clips that often go viral.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    She has entertained audiences with her spot-on impersonations of well-known political figures, using humor to comment on social issues in a way that resonates with Filipinos from all walks of life.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Among her most memorable characters are Nanette Nafoolish, a spoof of Janet Napoles; Vagigi Reyes, inspired by Vangie Reyes; Jubis Kuneho, based on Deniece Cornejo; Dra. Becki Belat, a parody of Dr. Vicki Belo; and Leila Dilema, a take on Leila de Lima.

                    Another fan favorite is Madame Lucky Tian, her flamboyant fortune teller persona, known for her outrageous and often eerily accurate predictions. One of her most recent viral moments came from her portrayal of Alice Gugo, a satirical version of former Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban. Just a day after she posted the clip, the real Alice Guo was captured in Indonesia, causing Nanette’s video to resurface and go viral again.

                    “I never expected my parody to take off like that! People were sending me messages, saying, ‘Nanette, you predicted it!’ Of course, it’s all in good fun, but moments like these remind me how powerful comedy can be. It allows us to reflect on real-life events in a way that makes people laugh but also think,” she shared.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Beyond her growing online presence, Nanette is also working on several exciting projects. She is set to star in a new film, with shooting scheduled to begin in April. Though she remains tight-lipped about the details, she hints that the project will showcase a different side of her acting abilities. Additionally, she is gearing up for a U.S. tour with fellow female comedians within the year.

                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    “I’m excited to be traveling again internationally for comedy at this stage in my career. When I started, we didn’t have social media, and everything was about television and live performances,” she said. “Now, the world is different, and I get to reach people in ways I never thought possible. This tour is a dream come true because I’ll be joined with my collegues and because I’ll be performing for Filipinos abroad who have supported me for years.”
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    Despite her decades in the industry, Nanette remains as passionate as ever about entertaining and staying relevant. Her ability to evolve with the times, from television to social media, is proof that talent, when combined with adaptability, can transcend generations.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    “Everything seems to be falling into place! Thanks to my production team at Stages Sessions, I’ve been able to take a big leap into this exciting, democratized world of online entertainment. There’s a newfound freedom, and I feel like I’ve gotten a second wind to explore even more. As long as I stay observant, I know there will always be something new to create. It’s an exciting phase, and I’m ready to take on the challenge head-on,” she said.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text-tf">
                    With her signature wit, charm and sharp comedic instincts, Nanette continues to prove that reinvention is always possible. Whether through live performances, film, or the ever-changing world of social media, one thing remains constant — her ability to make people laugh and think, a legacy that will undoubtedly endure for years to come.
